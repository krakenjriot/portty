# Learn how to use and test your Arduino board, without learning to program
## portty.exe is a small application developed from python that enables anyone to manipulate Arduino pins state by using a simple set of commands

## The application uses the toggle concept - which means, every time you trigger the pin using the portty.exe, the application will reverse the pin current state from ## 0 to 1 and vice versa.
